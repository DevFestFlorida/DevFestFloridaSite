# **Announcing Speakers!**
We are so excited about Orlando’s first ever DevFest! We’ll be hosting the event at the Sheraton off of I-4 near Lake Buena Vista. We have
a spectacular lineup of topics and speakers. This includes <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/experts/">Google Developer Experts</a>
(GDEs) in combination with a diverse lineup of speakers with a wide range of experience. The event will have two concurrent tracks,
one for <b style="color: #78C257">Android</b> and one for <b style="color: #2196F3">Web and Cloud</b> development.

<br>

Some of the incredible <b style="color: #78C257">Android</b> talks include “Multi-Window and Your App” by CommonsWare Founder, Mark Murphy and
“Developing Apps for Daydream and Tango” by Android GDE Etienne Caron from Shopify!

**Mark Murphy’s** talk is sure to enlighten! Come explore how to support multi-window modes in your Android applications, with particular
emphasis on the split-screen mode for phones and tablets. Come examine what quirks will be seen with multi-window mode and what sorts of UX
decisions you will need to make as a result. Mark will also cover how to start testing your app in these modes, so you can begin making
tactical changes and run experiments for longer-term strategic choices.

**Etienne Caron’s** talk ‘Developing Apps for Daydream and Tango’ will be filled with exploration and learning as well! Starting an App
with a Virtual or Augmented reality component is a bit daunting for most. When starting out, frameworks like Unity3D or Unreal Engine
simplify a great many things. But, from an Android developer perspective, you need to forget all about the nice APIs and libraries you're
used to. You'll need to shoehorn your business logic in frameworks that are designed to build games first, not apps -- not a great
proposition.

Have no fear though! Etienne is here to help guide us as we explore the path less traveled together! In this session, we'll see how you can
build VR and AR applications, in Java and Android Studio, thanks to Google's Daydream and Tango Java SDKs, plus a few helpful 3D graphics
libraries.

Our <b style="color: #2196F3">Web and Cloud</b> is packed full of content and great speakers! We have local developers.
Angular GDE Alyssa Nicoll of WeaveUp and Neela Balkaran of Ultimate Software will be presenting. We're also bringing in Juniper Belmont
of Vaadin from Seattle and Mike Brocchi of CEI from Pittsburgh!

**Juniper Belmont** is a developer advocate who is passionate about the open web platform. Their talk will be on the newest big thing,
Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). PWAs, while the new hot tomato, should not be simply endorsed or rejected. More than a set of technologies,
PWAs are about reframing how we build apps for the web and mobile. June will show us how you can build speed ,security and responsiveness
right into your app instead of relying on fast devices and connections. Come learn how to make your web app do everything native apps can
do without rewriting your entire codebase for different platforms!

The crazy and wonderful **Mike Brocchi** will be talking to us about ‘Angular 2 - Removing the Chaos’. Mike is a contributor and
collaborator on the Angular CLI project and more than qualified to speak on the subject of Angular. His talk will throw aside the
frightening and frankly unnecessarily long list of transpiling, minifying, module imports, bundling, dev environment, production releases,
code consistency, and testing. All of these things clutter our brains and detract greatly from actual development. Come join Mike in
creating an Angular app by setting aside all of these concerns and focusing in on creating features that users truly care about.

**Neela Balkaran** is a kind and knowledgeable developer who will be talking on the daring topic of ‘Killing the Relations with BigTable’.
In a world with a seemingly infinite amount of data, the way we store and retrieve data is becoming of ever increasing importance.
Enter: BigTable. Neela will pull on her dev experiences from Interning at Google, to developing at Code School and Lockheed Martin as she
shows us what BigTable is, how it works, and why you might want to consider trying out a NoSQL database.

Our keynote will be covered by the zany and passionate **Alyssa Nicoll**. She is going to talk about how ‘Innovating is not about
technology, but psychology’. Alyssa recently left her comfy job at Code School to dive head first into development. Her talk comes from her
experiences through development, the good times as well as the scary ones. Come examine our motives as developers — learn why we do what we
do, why we try so very hard, and what the cost of being great looks like.
