We want to thank **Nativescript** by Progress for being one of DevFest Florida’s Gold Sponsors.

[NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/) is a free and open source framework for building truly native mobile apps with JavaScript, TypeScript or Angular. Even though NativeScript does not use HTML, nor run in a web view container, you can style your NativeScript application with CSS and use common frameworks and tools like npm, Node.JS, WebPack and SASS.

It’s easy [to get started with NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/getting-started-with-nativescript). Once you have your emulator(s) properly set up, and environment configured, it’s as easy as running this command:
npm install -g nativescript

You can even use NativeScript inside of an existing Android or iOS application. In fact, many of our users find it hard to find and recruit native developers. They use NativeScript to solve this problem by allowing more readily available JavaScript developers to come in and work on the same application. This workflow helps close the developer resource gap without compromising on features, reliability, user experience or performance.
