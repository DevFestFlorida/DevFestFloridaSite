# **Announcing Speakers!**
We are so excited about Orlando’s first ever DevFest! We’ll be hosting the event at the Sheraton off of I-4 near Lake Buena Vista. We have a spectacular lineup of topics and speakers. The event will have two concurrent tracks, one for Android and one for Web and Cloud development. Some of the incredible Android talks include “Multi-Window and Your App” by CommonsWare Founder, Mark Murphy along with a talk on “Developing Apps for Daydream and Tango” by Shopify’s Etienne Caron!

**Mark Murphy’s** talk is sure to enlighten! Come explore how to support multi-window modes in your Android applications, with particular emphasis on the split-screen mode for phones and tablets. Come examine what quirks will be seen with multi-window mode and what sorts of UX decisions you will need to make as a result. Mark will also cover how to start testing your app in these modes, so you can begin making tactical changes and run experiments for longer-term strategic choices.

**Etienne Caron’s** talk ‘Developing Apps for Daydream and Tango’ will be filled with exploration and learning as well! Starting an App with a Virtual or Augmented reality component is a bit daunting for most. When starting out, frameworks like Unity3D or Unreal Engine simplify a great many things. But, from an Android developer perspective, you need to forget all about the nice APIs and libraries you're used to. You'll need to shoehorn your business logic in frameworks that are designed to build games first, not apps -- not a great proposition.

Have no fear though! Etienne is here to help guide us as we explore the path less traveled together! In this session, we'll see how you can build VR and AR applications, in Java and Android Studio, thanks to Google's Daydream and Tango Java SDKs, plus a few helpful 3D graphics libraries.

Our web lineup is no less exciting. We have our very own local Web devs, Alyssa Nicoll and Neela Balkaran coming in to speak, as well as Juniper Belmont and Mike Brocchi flying in to speak!

**Juniper Belmont** is a developer advocate who is passionate about the open web platform. Their talk will be on the newest big thing, Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). PWAs, while the new hot tomato, should not be simply endorsed or rejected. More than a set of technologies, PWAs are about reframing how we build apps for the web and mobile. June will show us how you can build speed ,security and responsiveness right into your app instead of relying on fast devices and connections. Come learn how to make your web app do everything native apps can do without rewriting your entire codebase for different platforms!

The crazy and wonderful **Mike Brocchi** will be talking to us about ‘Angular 2 - Removing the Chaos’. Mike is a contributor and collaborator on the Angular CLI project and more than qualified to speak on the subject of Angular. His talk will throw aside the frightening and frankly unnecessarily long list of transpiling, minifying, module imports, bundling, dev environment, production releases, code consistency, and testing. All of these things clutter our brains and detract greatly from actual development. Come join Mike in creating an Angular app by setting aside all of these concerns and focusing in on creating features that users truly care about.

**Neela Balkaran** is a kind and knowledgeable developer who will be talking on the daring topic of `Killing the Relations with BigTable`. In a world with a seemingly infinite amount of data, the way we store and retrieve data is becoming of ever increasing importance. Enter: BigTable. Neela will pull on her dev experiences from Interning at Google, to developing at Code School and Lockheed Martin as she shows us what BigTable is, how it works, and why you might want to consider trying out a NoSQL database.

Our keynote will be covered by the zany and passionate **Alyssa Nicoll**. She is going to talk about how innovating is not about technology, but psychology. Alyssa recently left her comfy job at Code School to dive head first into development. Her talk comes from her experiences through development, the good times as well as the scary ones. Come examine our motives as developers — learn why we do what we do, why we try so very hard, and what the cost of being great looks like.

As amazing as all these speakers are though, we still have more to come! Checkout the full list below of our amazing speakers for DevFest 2016. Better hurry and purchase your tickets now, you really won’t want to miss this years show.
