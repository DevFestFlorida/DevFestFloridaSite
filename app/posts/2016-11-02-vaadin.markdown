We want to thank **Vaadin** for being one of DevFest Florida’s Gold Sponsors.

**Vaadin** has long believed in building a better web. With tools and components, we give developers the ability to focus on building their
application. With trainings and tutorials we also give developers the skills to succeed.
<a href="https://vaadin.com/elements" target="_blank">Vaadin Elements</a> is a set of open source web components that can be used with any library or
framework and reflect our commitment to the open web standards. Fully utilizing the web platform is key to creating the next generation of
web apps.

By the same token, we’ve committed to building and promoting Progressive Web Apps as this next generation. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are
web apps that use the best new features of the web platform to create high quality web applications that can even look and feel like
native mobile apps.

Vaadin Developer Advocate <a href="/speakers/5">Juniper Belmont</a> will be giving a talk at GDG DevFest Florida 2016, in which you will
learn about Progressive Web Apps, when you might want to use them, and when you might not. It’s one thing to learn a tool, but another to
know when to use it.
