[DevFest Florida 2016](https://devfest.ineedtobeupdated.com) is the first combined DevFest being organized by three Google Developer Groups in the central Florida area: Space Coast, Central Florida and Sun Coast. We're looking forward to bringing great Google technology content to you, the developers that help support and make up our groups. We're also looking forward to hosting those that want to enjoy some really nice weather in November while learning a bit more about what's new with Google technology. This is going to be the BIGGEST Google event in Florida this year!

DevFest Florida 2016 is going to take place on November 5th, 2016 at **TODO** [Add this](http://www.google.com). DevFest Florida is going to be focused on Android & Web technologies while also offering all participants with a mixer to meet other professionals and students in the area. It'll be a great way to get to know your Google tech neighbors.

In most parts of the country in November the weather is lousy. Before the holidays are upon us pack a bag and join us for some fantastic weather and even better speakers! While you're hear enjoy some great food and drink or maybe head off to the beach. Not a lot of tech conferences can offer you all of that.
