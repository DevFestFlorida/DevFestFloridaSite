# **Tango? Sorry, I don't dance**
So if you thought DevFest Florida was holding a dance competition you're out of luck. Although maybe next year? No we're talking about Tango, which was formerly Project Tango. Tango is computer vision platform that lets certain Android phones and tablets understand their position relative to its surroundings without using GPS. This allows you to build some advanced augmented reality apps. You may have seen some of the apps at your local I/O Extended event. Like the dinosaurs on stage OR the Wayfair unboxing of furniture in your house to check out what that piece would look like in your own home. Check out a brief demo below of just one of the things you can do with Tango.

# **What's this about a Tango Hackathon?**

DevFest Florida 2016 is running a Tango Hackathon. Attendees to DevFest are welcome to compete and we'll post the rules and prizes for the hackathon soon. We're going to have some Tango devices on hand for participants to test their apps out on. With the success of Pokemon Go, one of the most popular augmented reality apps on the market today you should definitely be checking out Tango and how to incorporate it into your apps.

As DevFest Florida is a single day event we are encouraging folks to get familiar with the APIs and even start building your apps or getting the artwork and design done before the event. In fact if you want to show up with a finished app that's ready but not yet in the Play Store that's fine too. At the end of the day you'll get the chance to showcase your app to the audience. Even if you don't win you'll reach a bunch of customers and we'll write up a blog post and share your app on our social media channels... FREE PUBLICITY!!!

+ Participants will have to sign up. There will be a form coming out soon with the official rules.
+ You can pair up into teams of no more than four (3).
+ Your app can be written with any of the Tango APIs that you chose to use (e.g. Java, Unity, etc.)
+ Apps will be judged on their creativity and their ability to be uploaded to the Google Play store.
