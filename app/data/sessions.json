    "description": "If you need to build a MVP for an idea or startup, then you need to have tools that work right now and ultra-productive. Angular 2 provides a great starting point for this, but you still need to handle Authentication, database, back-end servers, and quality UI components. AngularFire2 makes the Authentication easy. It provides a real-time, managed database. This means no servers to setup! Angular2-Polymer gives you easy access to the huge library of standards-based Polymer Web Components. This includes Material Design components, Flexbox Layouts, data grids, and Google components like Google Maps.",
